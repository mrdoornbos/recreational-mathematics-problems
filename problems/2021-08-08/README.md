# Largest And Smallest Numbers

This week's puzzle continues the divisibility theme from last week.

There are two parts:

a) For each value of *n*, from 2 to 16, find the largest and smallest nine-digit numbers, containing each of the nine nonzero digits exactly once, that are exactly divisible by *n*.

b) Do the same for ten-digit numbers containing each of the ten digits (including 0) exactly once. (Note that 0 may not be the first digit of a number.)
