    "In case it's not too obvious to state, each digit in a number is a number to be multiplied by a power of 10 in a sum. For instance: `1,234 = 1,000 + 200 + 30 + 4 = 1*10^3 + 2*10^2 + 3*10^1 + 4*10^0`\n",

    "\n",
    "Looking at that formula, we can see that the \"base number\" is 503,010,672 when we set all the blanks to 0. Then for each permutation (ordering) a,b,c of {4,9,8}, we have a number `p = a*10,000,000 + b*100,000 + c*1,000`. There will be 6 of these, as there are 6 orderings possible of 3 unique digits: 4,9,8; 4,8,9; 9,4,8...\n",

    "Modulo arithmetic (sometimes called \"clock arithmetic\") is arithmetic in which we only count remainders. The \"clock arithmetic\" moniker comes from the fact that this is how a 24-hour clock works (and a 12-hour clock, if you substitute \"0\" for \"12\" and ignore AM/PM). If it's 23:00 (11 PM) and you add 2 hours, it's not 25:00 (13 PM) but 1:00 (1 AM), because 25 mod 24 = 1 (13 mod 12 = 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the top of the clock and getting back there means going completely around, no matter how many times we go around. So any number _n_ we add to, say, our 24 hour clock that is divisible by 24 just gets us back to the top after going around _n_ / 24 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we understand that we're in a cyclic system, we realize that we are just walking around our limited circle of numbers and seeing where we stop. You could think of any number _n_ as `n = x*m + r`, with _x_ trips the whole way around the clock and a remainder _r_. We can throw away _x_ because each time we take _m_ steps we're back at 0, so `n mod m = r`. If _r_ = 0, we made a whole number of trips, and _n_ must have been divisible by _m_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight: A number _s_ mod _m_ is equal to the sum of _n1, n2, ..._ mod _m_ if the sum of _n1 + n2 + ..._ equals _s_\n",
    "\n",
    "Now think of breaking our trip up into smaller segments _n_ = _a_,_b_,_c_... It doesn't matter what those segments are, since we'll end up at the same place as if we took the trip _n_ all at once.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- The value of the \"blank\" number with zeros in the blank spaces `n = 503,010,672`\n",
    "- The value of _n_ modulo 792 `mn = 503,010,672 mod 792 = 384`\n",

    "When we are doing this work on a contemporary computer, it's tempting to use brute force to solve these problems. Even if we had 10 blank digits, there are only `10! = 3,628,800` permutations of the 10 digits (`9! = 362,880` if you don't use zeros), and asking a computer to do a few million divisibility checks won't take any time at all. (The environment I'm writing this in takes < 1 second to iterate through all possible permutations of 10 digits.) In fact, the algorithm we implement here will still technically be brute force, but it will be checking every combination of digits for divisibility instead of checking just the resultant value. It's slower than just checking that resultant value, but still pretty much instantaneous.\n",

    "- Neither number ends in \"0\" (to keep things interesting)\n",
    "- If the 9-digit number is odd, so is the 3-digit number (to keep things possible - an odd number cannot be evenly divided by an even number)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also look for every possible solution, including ones that have repeated digits or use 0's. The output will be quite verbose, so we can see how the solution was found."
