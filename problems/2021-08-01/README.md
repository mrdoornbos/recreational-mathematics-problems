# Blank Divisibility

This week's puzzle is about filling in blanks in a number so that it's divisible by another number.

How many ways are there to fill in the blanks for

5_3_1_672

with the digits 4, 9, and 8, in some order, so that the resulting number is divisible by 792?

_This problem is Problem 4.33 in Problem Solving Through Recreational Mathematics by Bonnie Averbach and Orin Chein._

Feel free to use your favorite programming language to solve the problem.

If you can immediately see a way to solve this problem with code, then I challenge you to come up with a solution that *doesn't* check all possible combinations of 4, 9, and 8. Can you find a way to limit the search space?

You can submit solutions via pull request or by emailing your code to recmath@davidamos.dev. If you submit a pull request, make sure your solution is added to the `solutions/community/` folder.
